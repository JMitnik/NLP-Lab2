\section{Models}
\label{sec: models}
A number of models are trained with the following parameters:

\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Model  & Loss & Hidden size & params \\
BOW          & -             & -           & -                \\
CBOW         &               &             &                  \\
Deep CBOW    &               &             &                  \\
LSTM         &               &             &                  \\
Mini LSTM    &               &             &                  \\
Tree LSTM    &               &             &                  \\
Subtree LSTM &               &             &                 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For implementation, for Tree LSTMs, the N-Ary tree was chosen due to a more
granular storage of weight matrices. The dimension size of the embedding vector
was chosen to be 300 for all models except for BOW.
