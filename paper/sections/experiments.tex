The main goal of this research is to predict the sentiment of a corpus using
different models. The dataset that this task uses is the Stanford
Sentiment Treebank\cite{socher2013recursive}. This dataset consists of 10.662
excerpts from longer-form movie reviews. Over all the sentences, a total of
215.154 annotated phrases can be found. Each of these reviews have an associated
sentiment score from the originating review, and each of these phrases have an
associated sentiment score through human annotation. As such, this dataset can 
capture a semblance of fine-grained sentiment per-phrase and per-sentence.

Each model has been trained three times, each time under a different random
seed. These seeds are 7, 42 and 1984. Table [x] represents the number of times
each model is trained, as well as the learning rate of the optimizer and [number
of parameters]. Most of the model will be initialized with pre-trained
GloVe\cite{pennington2014glove} embedding vectors of size 300: those which
don't, initialize their embedding vectors of size 300 from words in the corpus
with weights set to arbitrary number. The pre-trained embeddings are furthermore
set to fixed for the duration of the training.
Adam\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/KingmaB14} is used to perform learning, with
parameters being $\beta_{1}=0.9$ and $\beta_{2}=0.999$ and $eps=1e-08$. Adam is
a variant on Stochastic Gradient Descent, which uses an exponential moving
average of the gradient and squared gradient to control decay of each parameter.
The loss function is the Cross Entropy Loss for each model.

During the training, a model is given a sentence with the corresponding label
from the corpus. This label will be the truth value and used to supervise the
model during training. Finally, the model performance will be evaluated using
[accuracy], along with a significance test to compare which model performs
better.

For research question 3, an additional separate trial will be run to train
Tree-LSTMs. The Tree-LSTM models are supervised per node, instead of on the root
node. [This is done by extracting all subtrees using an external algorithm
written for this purpose.]
% TODO: Gongze, do we reference this library, or deny its existence and just 
% assume they believe us?

For research question 4, each of the examples in the test-set will be grouped by
the number of tokens inside the sentence. The test-set is fragmented in groups
of range 5, e.g. sentences of length 1-5, 5-10, and so on. Each model will then
calculate results for each of these bins.

% TODO: Anymore experiments can go here.
