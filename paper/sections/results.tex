\section{Results and Analysis}
\label{sec: results}
Table \ref{table: results-acc} shows the accuracy on the testset for each model,
averaged over three runs with different seeds. Several abbreviations
clarification: DCBOW stands for Deep CBOW, DCBOW-PT stands for Deep CBOW with
pretrained embedding, Mini-LSTM means vanilla LSTM trained with minibatch,
T-LSTM stands for Tree-LSTM, and ST-LSTM is the tree LSTM trained with per-node
supervision. \\ Table \ref{table: sign} reflects the significance of these
predictions when compared to another model. The [conjunction] of these metrics
makes it possible to answer a number of research questions. \\

    \vspace{-10pt}
    \subsection{How important is word order for the task of classification of
    sentiment?} To answer this question, one only has to compare the accuracy
    results of BOW-like models and vanilla LSTM. Note that most of the BOW
    models are trained with random embedding initialization, except for
    DCBOW-PT, so it is only fair to compare between DCBOW-PT with LSTM. And we
    can see LSTM is about 3 persents over the DCBOW-PT, which is already a big
    gap.
    \subsection{Does tree structure improve the accuracy as opposed to
    sequential learning?}
