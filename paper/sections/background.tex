\subsubsection{CBOW and Deep CBOW}
The bag of words model is a popular and frequently used model to start
exploration of data. The algorithm works by counting the number of times a word
has occurred in the corpus. The simplicity of the algorithm has as consequence
that no word-order is being memorized.
